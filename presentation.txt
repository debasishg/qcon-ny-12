Entities as Algebraic Data Types
  - immutability
  - type safe pattern matching
  - currying
  - algebra, hence reasoning

Functional Updates
  - Lenses
  - Zippers

Typeclasses for post hoc polymorphism
  - diff with subtyping
  - domain behaviors can change, typeclass based approach scales better than subtyping
  - notable typeclasses, monoids, semi-groups, monads

Reasoning about the domain model
  - Equational Reasoning
  - Property based testing using QuickCheck / ScalaCheck
